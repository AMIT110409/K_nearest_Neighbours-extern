K-nearest neighbors (KNN) is a simple, versatile, non-parametric supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. The algorithm works by finding the k most similar instances in the training set to a new instance and then predicting the label of the new instance based on the labels of the k nearest neighbors.

Here are the steps involved in the KNN algorithm:

Choose the value of k. The value of k is a hyperparameter that needs to be chosen by the user. A larger value of k will make the algorithm more robust to noise, but it will also make the algorithm less accurate. A smaller value of k will make the algorithm more accurate, but it will also make the algorithm more sensitive to noise.
Find the k nearest neighbors. For each new instance, the algorithm finds the k most similar instances in the training set. Similarity is typically measured using a distance metric, such as the Euclidean distance or the Manhattan distance.
Predict the label of the new instance. The label of the new instance is predicted by majority vote. For classification tasks, the label of the new instance is the most common label among the k nearest neighbors. For regression tasks, the label of the new instance is the average of the labels of the k nearest neighbors.
Here are some of the advantages of using the KNN algorithm:

It is simple and easy to understand.
It is versatile and can be used for both classification and regression tasks.
It is robust to noise.
It can handle a variety of data types, including categorical and continuous data.
Here are some of the disadvantages of using the KNN algorithm:

It can be computationally expensive to find the k nearest neighbors.
It can be sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters.
It can be slow to predict new instances.
The KNN algorithm is a powerful tool that can be used for a variety of machine learning tasks. It is simple to understand and implement, and it can be used with a variety of data types. However, it can be computationally expensive to find the k nearest neighbors, and it can be sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters.
